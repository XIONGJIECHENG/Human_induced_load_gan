# Generative Adversarial Networks for Simulating Human-induced Loads
The code 'gene_sample' shows the GAN architecture for simulating human-induced Loads. With the required packages and the trained weights, is's utilized to generate differnent types of human-induced loads.

## The following packages are required:
* Python 3.6
* Tensorflow 1.1
* Scipy
* Numpy

## Trained weights
