# Generative Adversarial Networks for Simulating Human-induced Loads
The code 'gene_sample' shows the GAN architecture for simulating human-induced Loads. With the required packages and the trained weights, is's utilized to generate differnent types of human-induced loads.

## The following packages are required:
* Python 3.6
* Tensorflow 1.1
* Scipy
* Numpy

## Trained weights
The weights of training 1 million times using real samplesï¼š[Trained Weights](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zLen63lKyv1qlwWiyPUyaSeSL2Mbj46U).

## Types of generated samples
* gene_samples1  1.50 Hz walking
* gene_samples2  1.75 Hz walking
* gene_samples3  2.00 Hz walking
* gene_samples4  2.25 Hz walking
* gene_samples5  1.50 Hz jumping
* gene_samples6  2.00 Hz jumping
* gene_samples7  2.67 Hz jumping
* gene_samples8  3.50 Hz jumping
* gene_samples9  1.50 Hz bouncing
* gene_samples10 2.10 Hz bouncing
* gene_samples11 2.70 Hz bouncing
